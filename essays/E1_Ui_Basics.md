For the first Wod, Browser History 1, I was pretty confused about how to follow the directions and where to find the correct tags needed for the assignment. As this was the first time I had been writing code on my own I got stuck a lot and had a lot of small mistakes and errors that caused me to get stuck a lot. After I had gotten stuck enough and felt like I had tried to figure it out I watched the screen recording and it helped a lot for me to figure out the correct tags, syntax, and how I should be formatting my code. After watching the screencast I still DNF. I ended up taking notes from the screencast and making a small list of important tags I would need to use in the WOD. This has helped me to see the syntax and remind me of elements I must include in the website when the Wod instructions didn't give me enough information. This helped me to understand the elements of the site I was making and made it much easier to complete the Wod at an appropriate time. 

For my second WOD, Browser History 2, I was able to complete it much faster than Browser History 1 after knowing what was expected of me in Browser History 1. Understanding that I had to go find the tags I needed and look further than the instructions took me a while for browser history 1. However, this was my first time using CSS on my own in a while therefore I had lots of roadblocks and errors. One of my biggest struggles with this WOD was understanding how to define the HTML elements and edit them in CSS. I watched the screencast for this WOD as well and it helped me to understand some tags that I was missing along with the format of the portions of CSS code. 


For my third WOD, Browser History 3, I looked at the screencast to understand the nav bar and columns. The Screencast gave valuable information that I could not figure out, for example creating my left and right column before my center column helped me get my column inline while I was unable to before. This also helped me to space out my nav bar as that was another thing I was struggling with.
